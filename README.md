Trying out Rails
----------------

I'm new to Rails. And I want to learn more. This repository documents my 'learning' process, while still trying to keep it a singular project with a specific use-case in mind.

It's live @ [ollpu.zah.fi](http://ollpu.zah.fi/), currently running a free Heroku plan, so it might take a while to load up the first time someone goes there in 30 minutes.
